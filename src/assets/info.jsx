  generalInfo: `This website contains an expanding selection of photographs shot after 2021, portraying various locations and taken with a wide array of devices and lenses.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  My gear includes a FujiFilm X-T1 digital camera used in combination with several Fujica lenses and a few self-made custom lenses (pinhole, lenses disassembled from broken cameras), a Rollei 35 analog camera, a Ricoh Caplio G4 and a Sony Cybershot.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  My style is rooted in street photography. I am also very passionate about architectural photography and capturing portraits of people going about their lives.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  This website also includes some digital art. I'm passionate about the intersection between technology and art, and I've found in TouchDesigner a powerful and versatile tool to materialize my aesthetic in a way not always possible with photography.
